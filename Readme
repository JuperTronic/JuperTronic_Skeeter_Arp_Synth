Skeeter is an Arduino based syth box that plays pre-programmed arpeggios or sequences. 
The sounds are created by the Mozzi synth library which you will need to download and install. 
You'll also need to install the MIDI.h library so the synth can accept external MIDI input to change the root note.
Toggle through the arpeggio sequences using the up and down momentary normally open buttons.
Latch on to a drone note sequence with the latching button. This button is lighed. Light comes on when latched.
This is a great feature for jamming - twirl the LFO and phase on the drone, then jump into a sequence.
Light also blinks on last note of sequence when unlatched for timing que to change sequences.
You can change sequences while the drone button is latched. 
Arpeggio sequence will start at the first note in the sequence when drone is unlatched.
5 Potentiometers control arpeggio rate, note length or legato, phase, low pass filter, and note pitch. 
A default root note is programmed in so the box will play when no MIDI is hooked up. 
There is a sync out jack for use with a drum machine like Korg Volca or Pocket Operator. Timing can get a little weird if you 
make drastic adjustments to the legato setting while playing due to the way the Mozzi is coded here. Very useful though.
